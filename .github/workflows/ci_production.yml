                  # It seems that Webpack 5 or vite are needed.
                  # Webpack 4 is not compatible with NodeJS >= 17 and OpenSSL 3
                  # But
                  # Webpack 5 is not compatible with NuxtJS 2.x
                  # Vite is not compatible with vuetify 2.x
                  # So maybe wait for nuxt 3.0 / vuetify 3.x
